// Deduplicate Sorted Array

// Objectives

// Get more familiarity with for loops and arrays
// Think about for loops in more interesting ways

// Implement deduplicateSortedArray(arr), a function that accepts one argument: an array of items (arr). This array of items could be numbers or strings, but not both. The important thing to note is that the array is guaranteed to be sorted - you don't need to do it manually, you can assume that input will be in sorted order.
// The function's output will be the same array, but with all duplicate items in it removed. For example, if your input was [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6], your expected output would be [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] - essentially, each item should only be in the array once. You very specifically want to do this in-place - you modify the array you're given. You can return that array if you want, but it's not necessary.

// Once you complete the function: are there other ways to do it? (Hint: there are definitely other ways to do it.) Try writing out another solution with your group. Is one more readable than the other? Is one more efficient? 

function deduplicateSortedArray(arr) {
    // iterate through each index
    for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {

        // if the value at the next index is the same value as the current index
        if(arr[i] == arr[i + 1]) {

            // iterate through remainder of array, shift values left to overwrite value at i + 1
            // j < arr.length - 1: you don't need to/can't overwrite the value at the last index, because there's nothing to its right
            for(var j = i + 1; j < arr.length - 1; j++) {
                arr[j] = arr[j + 1]
            }

            // remove last index
            arr.length -= 1;

            // set iterator back so it will recheck the current index against the new shifted value on its right
            i--;
        }
    }
}

// Things to consider:
// There are lots of ways of solving this problem - if your group has multiple passionate people, you may get bogged down in deciding which solution to pursue. There's merit in trying to find the best course of action before beginning a task, but overthinking and overplanning is a risk. Remember that a good, working solution that runs and is demonstratable is better than a perfect solution that exists only in your head.

let test_a = [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 5, 8, 9, 9, 10, 12, 12, 12];
deduplicateSortedArray(test_a);
console.log(test_a); // returns [0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12]
let test_b = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7];
deduplicateSortedArray(test_b);
console.log(test_b); // returns [0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7]
let test_c = [];
deduplicateSortedArray(test_c);
console.log(test_c); // returns []
let test_d = [5, 6, 8, 9];
deduplicateSortedArray(test_d);
console.log(test_d); // returns [5, 6, 8, 9]
